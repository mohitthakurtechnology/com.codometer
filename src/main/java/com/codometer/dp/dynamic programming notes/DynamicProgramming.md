# Dynamic Programming 
	There are 2 keys to the DP which would solve the algorithmic and coding 
	as well as the real life problems in the day to day activity we are involved in
	First key is the Recursive Approach with Memoization to optimize the solution
	where we use the tree data structure to analyze the time and space complexity 
	with the big o 	notation.(number of inputs * amount of work done per input)
	Memoization is kind of caching your recursive call to reduce the cost or to avoid the costly operation.
		- Decision making
		- combination -> like permutation , combination
		- Optimize out of combinations

	Second key is the Tabulation where we use the table or array to sort the problem
	look for seeds in the problem before you design or build the sowing process for a tree.
